Variants for superior, inferior, projective, and injective limits are an interesting challenge for typesetting engines with mathematical capabilities.

They have both a subscript expression and a stretchy symbol (an arrow or a bar) that indicates the direction and nature of the limit.

The symbol is stacked below or above the limit.

In display mode, the expression is below the limit.

In inline mode, the expression is on the right of the limit, but the symbol remains above or below the limit.
So the symbol is not _moveable,_ while the expression is, depending on the context.
