Just the simplest way to get a phrase onto a numbered page.

The page size, font face, margins, and everything else should be the defaults.
The only non-default addition to the minimal way to get text on a page is adding a folio in the simplest way possible.
The position of the folio may vary depending on defaults, but if an explicit position is required use bottom center.
